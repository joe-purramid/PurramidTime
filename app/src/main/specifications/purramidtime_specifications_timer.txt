 --- RUNTIME EVENTS ---
(1) On first app-intent launch, the timer opens in a windowed state.
(2) The most recent timer user preferences are saved. Save the following:
	(2.1) Timer size
	(2.2) Background color
	(2.3) Set countdown time
	(2.4) Play Sound on Finish user definitions
	(2.5) User-defined music URLs
(3) On future app-intent launches, the timer loads saved user preferences.


 --- USER INTERFACE ---
(4) A Settings button is positioned in the bottom left corner.
	(4.1) Default icon state uses ic_settings.xml.
	(4.2) Active state: Programmatically change fill colores as per the Button Iplementation Guidelines.
(5) A Close button is positioned in the top right corner.
	(5.1) Default icon state uses ic_close.xml.
	(5.2) Active state: Programmatically change fill colores as per the Button Iplementation Guidelines.
(6) All timers use a digital clock face HH:MM:SS
    (6.1) Hundredths will be abbreviated as cs (centiseconds) in the instructions, but all user-facing strings say Hundredths.
    (6.2) If Hundredths is toggled on, time displays as HH:MM:SS.cs
        (6.2.1) Hundredths appear 0.6f the size of the other numbers.
        (6.2.2) Hundredths are separated from seconds with a period not a colon.

``BUTTONS``
(7) Below the timer clock is two buttons:
	(7.1) Play/Pause
		(7.1.1) Default state: ic_pause.xml
		(7.1.2) Active state: ic_play.xml
	(7.2) Reset
		(7.2.1) Default state: ic_reset.xml
		(7.2.2) Active state: Programmatically change fill colors for default state icons to #808080
	(7.3) Play/Pause is on the left, and Reset is on the right.
		(7.3.1) This order is reversed for right-to-left languages.

``NESTED``
(8) A nested timer:
    (8.1) is reduced in size, 75px by 75px
    (8.2) is affixed to the top right corner of the screen
        (8.2.1) This includes 20px of padding so that the timer does not appear flush against the edge
    (8.3) does not have any (7) control buttons visible.
    (8.4) can still be moved or resized by the user with dragging or pinching actions, like normal.
    (8.5) is stacked if multiple nested timers are added, with multiple timers in the top right corner of the screen 
		(8.5.1) Nested timers are are stacked one above the other, with the newest timer on the bottom.


 --- USER EXPERIENCE ---
(9) ``SETTINGS SUMMARY``
	(9.1) When a user touches the settings button
		(9.1.1) its icon changes from (4.1) Default to (4.2) Active.
		(9.1.2) time is paused if it is actively counting
	(9.2) When activated, a settings window opens with a smooth transition animation, as per the universal specifications.
		(9.2.1) The settings button remains active while the settings window is open.
		(9.2.2) The settings window is rows of strings and an icon:
			(9.2.2.1) "Colors"
				(9.2.2.1.1) Following the word "Color" is a color square
					(9.2.2.1.1.1) The fill for this square is the color current used for the timer background
					(9.2.2.1.1.2) The default color is White.
				(9.2.2.1.2) If the user taps the word "Color" or the color square, a color picker opens.
				(9.2.2.1.3) The color picker displays the six color options from PurramidPalette.kt
					(9.2.2.1.3.1) This color applies to the timer background
					(9.2.2.1.3.2) Timer numbers are either black and white depending on which option creates the best color contrast with the background color.
			(9.2.2.2) "Set Countdown"
				(9.2.2.2.1) Following the phrase "Set Countdown" is an edit button
					(9.2.2.2.1.1) Default state: ic_edit.xml
					(9.2.2.2.1.2) Active state: Programmatically change fill colors for default state icons to #808080
				(9.2.2.2.2) If the user taps the phrase "Set Countdown" or the edit button
					(9.2.2.2.2.1) the current time is displayed with all zeroes present for HH:MM:SS
						(9.2.2.2.2.1.1) For example, if time was 30:00, time would display as 00:30:00 when Set Countdown is open.
					(9.2.2.2.2.2) an up arrow appears above each numeral of HH:MM:SS
					(9.2.2.2.2.3) a down arrow appears below each numeral of HH:MM:SS
					(9.2.2.2.2.4) three circular buttons appear below the down arrows
						(9.2.2.2.2.4.1) a +1:00:00 button is centered between the two HH arrows
						(9.2.2.2.2.4.2) a +5:00 button is centered between the two MM arrows
						(9.2.2.2.2.4.3) a +0:30 button is centered between the two SS arrows
					(9.2.2.2.2.5) No arrows appear above or below centiseconds even if that setting is toggled on
					(9.2.2.2.2.6) If the user swipes a number 
						(9.2.2.2.2.6.1) upward
							(9.2.2.2.2.6.1.1) that number counts down in a smooth animation
							(9.2.2.2.2.6.1.2) the longer the swipe, the greater the change in numbers
						(9.2.2.2.2.6.2) downward
							(9.2.2.2.2.6.2.1) that number counts up in a smooth animation
							(9.2.2.2.2.6.2.2) the longer the swipe, the greater the change in numbers
						(9.2.2.2.2.6.3) If a user swipes again before the first animation completes, that animation continues until all swipes have been accounted for.
						(9.2.2.2.2.6.4) If the time change adds or subtracts an increment, that change is reflected in the time shown
							(9.2.2.2.2.6.4.1) For example, a user swipes down on the "tens second" numeral. When the number goes from 5 to 0, one minute is added to the "ones minute" numeral
					(9.2.2.2.2.7) If the user press-hold-drags a number, the behavior is the same as (9.2.2.2.3.6) except time changes only one number at a time.
				(9.2.2.2.3) The maximum time that can be set is 99:59:59.00
			(9.2.2.3) "Play Sound on Finish"
				(9.2.2.3.1) This setting option is only visible if timer mode is set to Countdown Timer.
				(9.2.2.3.2) Following the phrase "Play Sound on Finish" is a drop-down arrow.
					(9.2.2.3.2.1) The drop-down arrow's default state is ic_arrow_drop_down.xml
					(9.2.2.3.2.2) The drop-down arrow's active state is ic_arrow_drop_up.xml
				(9.2.2.3.3) If the user taps the word "Mode" or the drop-down arrow
					(9.2.2.3.3.1) A horizontal drop-down menu opens with a smooth animation.
						(9.2.2.3.3.1.1) The menu displays a "sounds" button and a "music" button
							(9.2.2.3.3.1.1.1) "Sounds" displays a list of sounds available on the device
							(9.2.2.3.3.1.1.2) "Music" displays the (9.2.2.4) Music URL interface
							(9.2.2.3.3.1.1.3) The functionality and behavior here is similar to the sounds/music options in the Android system alarm clock.
			(9.2.2.4) "Music URL"
				(9.2.2.4.1) Following the phrase "Set Music URL" is an edit button
					(9.2.2.4.1.1) Default state: ic_edit.xml
					(9.2.2.4.1.2) Active state: Programmatically change fill colors for default state icons to #808080
				(9.2.2.4.2) If the user taps the phrase "Music URL" or the edit button
					(9.2.2.4.2.1) A music window opens over the settings window
					(9.2.2.4.2.2) The top of the window includes:
						(9.2.2.4.2.2.1) A back arrow in the top left corner of the window.

								(9.2.2.4.2.2.1.3.1) The user returns to the main settings window.
						(9.2.2.4.2.2.2) A close button in the top right corner of the window.
							(9.2.2.4.2.2.2.1) Default icon state uses ic_close.xml.
							(9.2.2.4.2.2.2.2) Active state: Programmatically change fill colores as per the Button Iplementation Guidelines.
							(9.2.2.4.2.2.2.3) When activated all settings related windows close.
					(9.2.2.4.2.3) Below the back arrow and close button is a row consisting of:
						(9.2.2.4.2.3.1) the string "Music URL"
						(9.2.2.4.2.3.2) a text field
							(9.2.2.4.2.3.2.1) the text field includes the text (not string) https://

								(9.2.2.4.2.3.2.1.2) this text disappears when the user taps into the text field.
							(9.2.2.4.2.3.2.2) if the user taps the text field, the system keyboard opens
								(9.2.2.4.2.3.2.2.1) once the cursor is present in the text field, a press-hold event allows the user to paste URL text from the system clipboard
						(9.2.2.4.2.3.3) a play button
							(9.2.2.4.2.3.3.1) Default state: ic_play.xml

								(9.2.2.4.2.3.3.3.2) The music URL is played
									(9.2.2.4.2.3.3.3.2.1) If no supported music is at the defined URL, a snackbar warning opens that says "This is not a valid music URL. Please provide an updated URL to play."
									(9.2.2.4.2.3.3.3.2.2) The music plays until
										(9.2.2.4.2.3.3.3.2.2.1) the user taps the play button again
										(9.2.2.4.2.3.3.3.2.2.2) the user taps anywhere else on the screen
										(9.2.2.4.2.3.3.3.2.2.3) the music ends
											(9.2.2.4.2.3.3.3.2.2.3.1) music does not loop
								(9.2.2.4.2.3.3.3.3) Once music ends or is stopped, the play icon changes to its default state.
					(9.2.2.4.2.4) Below the music URL are the three most recently used URLs
						(9.2.2.4.2.4.1) The most recently used URL is on top
						(9.2.2.4.2.4.2) The least recently used URL is on bottom
						(9.2.2.4.2.4.3) If the user taps one of these URLs
							(9.2.2.4.2.4.3.1) it moves to the top of the three URL list
							(9.2.2.4.2.4.3.2) the URL text is added to the text field.
						(9.2.2.4.2.4.4) If the user adds a new music URL to the (9.2.2.4.2.3.2) text field, it will appear on the top of these three URLs the next time the user opens the settings.
					(9.2.2.4.2.5) If the user opens the Music URL setting after having added a URL previously during this app-intent active session, the URL appears
						(9.2.2.4.2.5.1) in the (9.2.2.4.2.3.2) text field
						(9.2.2.4.2.5.2) on the top entry of the three most recently used URLs.
			(9.2.2.5) "Nest Timer"

					(9.2.2.6.2.2) a new timer appears at the geometric center of the screen.
						(9.2.2.6.2.2.1) the new timer is offset 25px to the right and 25px down if a timer already exists at the center of the screen.
						(9.2.2.6.2.2.2) it adopts all the preferences of the timer from which it was opened
							(9.2.2.6.2.2.2.1) For example, a new timer opened from a 300px by 300px timer that has a light blue background would also be a 300px by 300px timer with a light blue background.
					(9.2.2.6.2.3) If four timers already exist on the screen, the Add Another setting is inactivated.
