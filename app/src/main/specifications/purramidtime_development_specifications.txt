                        23.4.3.3.5.6.1. that URL moves to row 2 if it was not already there
                        23.4.3.3.5.6.2. any other URLs move down just as in 23.4.3.3.5.4.5.

                        23.4.3.3.4.10.1. the stop button changes to a play button in the default state
                        23.4.3.3.4.10.2. music stops playing. It does not loop.

### PET SPACE and ACTION BUTTONS

#### REWARDS MODE FUNCTIONALITY
24. If a user taps the reward button:
    24.1. the button changes to an active state (color and background)
    24.2. a pop-up menu opens with a smooth animation
        24.2.1. The menu includes an alphabetical list of the celebrations that can be chosen, matching the list in 23.4.4.3.5.2.1.
        24.2.2. Each reward is followed by its redemptoin cost in parentheses, as defined in 23.4.4.3.5.1.3.
    24.3. When the user chooses a reward, the redemption cost is subtracted from the point total displayed in the point total circle
        24.3.1. For example, a class has 10 reward points. A student chooses to redeem Dance Party, which is set to 5 points in the settings. The value in the total point circle decreases from 10 to 5.
    24.4. If the user taps anywhere outside the reward redemption menu, the menu closes with a smooth animation.
25. If a user taps the minus button, the total displayed in the point total circle reduces by the increment defined in 23.4.4.3.5.1.3. 
    25.1. Points total can never be less than 0.
26. If a user taps the point total circle:
    26.1. A text box appears in the circle
    26.2. A cursor appears in the text field after the number shown
    26.3. The system numberpad opens
        26.3.1. If the user taps enter on the numberpad or taps outside the text field
            26.3.1.1. the text box disappears
            26.3.1.2. the cursor disappears
            26.3.1.3. the system numberpad closes
            26.3.1.4. the number liste din the text box is set as the current point total
27. If a user taps the plus button, the total displayed in the point total circle increases by the increment defined in 23.4.4.3.5.1.3.
    27.1. Points total can never be greater than 99.
28. If a user selects the reward "Treat", one of three animations randomly plays
    28.1. "Kibble"
    28.2. "Meatball"
    28.3. "Paste"
29. If a user selects the reward "Trick", one of three animations randomly plays
    29.1. "Backflip"
    29.2. "Roll over"
    29.3. "Shake hands"

#### RESPONSIVE MODE FUNCTIONALITY
30. When in Responsive Mode:
    30.1. the action buttons are not shown
    30.2. the pet space increases to fill this new space
    30.3. Decibel values are measured every 2 seconds
31. The pet behavior is based on the settings defined in 23.4.2.
32. If the app loses access to the microphone used to measure decibel levels:
    32.1. A snackbar opens with a warning: "Microphone not detected. Change to Rewards?"
        32.1.1. This includes 
            32.1.1.1. a cancel button that closes the snackbar and activates the "sleep" animation
            32.1.1.2. a switch button (with the string "Switch") that closes the snackbar and changes mode to Rewards
        32.1.2. The app should ping for a microphone every 0.2. seconds while the snackbar is open
    32.2. If the microphone is detected before the user chooses Cancel or Switch, the snackbar closes on its own.

#### ALARM FUNCTIONALITY
33. If an alarm is set and that time is reached:
    33.1. an alarm icon (ic_alarm.xml) appears in the bottom buffer of the pet space
        33.1.1. the icon color is red
        33.1.2. The icon animates, tilting left then tilting right, back and forth
    33.2. the chosen animation occurs
34. Both the alarm icon and the pet animation continue until the user taps the app window.
    34.1. Once tapped:
        34.1.1. the alarm icon disappears
        34.1.2. the pet behavior returns to its previously defined state
35. If the app is closed while an alarm is active, it is not active when the app launches again. 


## ACCESSIBLE DESIGN AND NAVIGATION
36. Coloring must meet WCAG 2.2 AA contrast standards
