# The Purramid - Code Style Guide

## Naming Conventions
- Naming: PurramidPets can be abbreviated as PurrPets in file titles for efficiency
- Activities: *Activity (e.g., PurrPetsActivity)
- Services: *Service (e.g., PurrPetsService)
- ViewModels: *ViewModel
- Repositories: *Repository
- Use lowercase for packages: com.purramid.purramidpets.*

## Resolution standards
- Pixel density must support 2k and 4k resolutions
- Default resolution is 4k
- 1k is unnecessary
- 8k is unnecessary at this time

## State Management
- Use sealed classes for UI states
- Use data classes for preferences
- Immutable data wherever possible

## Coroutines
- Use viewModelScope in ViewModels
- Use lifecycleScope in Activities
- Structured concurrency for Services

## Resource Organization
- Drawables: ic_* for icons, bg_* for backgrounds
- Strings: Organized by feature in strings.xml

## Localization
- Logs can be in English only
- All other text should be implemented as strings
- "Purramid" is never translated

## Button Activation
- Button icons will be 757575 when inactive (default state)
- Button icons will be 1976D2 when active (active state)
- Button background will be E3F2FD when active
- A ripple effect will occur with the onTouch event that activates the button.
- Use isActivated property for boolean on/off states
